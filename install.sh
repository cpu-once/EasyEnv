# logic lives in scripts/install/*.sh (one file per responsibility) so it's
# easy to read, test, and modify one phase at a time — see readme.md.

# Where to fetch a fresh checkout from, when there isn't one on disk already.
# NOTE: kept in sync by hand with uninstall.sh's copy of these same two
# lines. This file runs via `curl | bash` before any repo is on disk, so it
# can't `source` lib.sh for a shared constant (chicken-and-egg: lib.sh lives
# inside the very repo this script's job is to fetch). If you change the
# defaults here, change uninstall.sh too.
#
# Pinned to a specific commit, not a floating branch name (TASK-117.1,
# decision-1). Before this, `--branch main` trusted whatever `main`
# happened to point to at the exact instant curl|sh ran - a force-pushed
# bad commit landing in that window would get executed sight unseen. This
# defends against unintended branch drift, a leaked-but-limited push token,
# and gives every curl|sh run a reproducible, auditable exact commit (see
# docs/download-integrity-techniques.md #8 and decision-1 for what this
# does and does NOT defend against - a full repo/account takeover can
# rewrite this very constant too, which decision-1 explicitly puts outside
# this script's threat model).
#
# Bump the BRANCH default by hand whenever you want curl|sh to pick up work
# merged to main since the last pin: `git rev-parse origin/main` on a fresh
# checkout, paste the result here (and into uninstall.sh's copy).
#
# LANGTOOLCHAIN_REPO_URL / LANGTOOLCHAIN_BRANCH (TASK-117.6): explicit
# opt-in overrides for testing against a fork or a different ref, without
# touching the trusted default path above - decision-1's scope already
# rules out a self-referential pin defending against a full account
# takeover, so accepting an override here doesn't weaken anything the
# default path actually promised. Only fires the warning below when one of
# these is actually set, so the default (no env vars) path stays silent.

# exists to close — `git fetch` alone has no wall-clock cap, only a
# connect-then-stall guard (which never engages if the connection
# blackholes before any byte moves, decision-10) — but this file can't
# `source` lib.sh (see the note above: no repo on disk yet, chicken-and-
# egg) and can't rely on `timeout(1)`/`gtimeout(1)` either (decision-10:
# neither ships pre-Homebrew, and this file runs at the very first entry
# point, before Homebrew is guaranteed to exist). So this is a small
# inline duplicate of lt_run_with_timeout()'s wall-clock-kill idea instead
# of a shared call — same reasoning as REPO_URL/BRANCH/clone_pinned()
# itself already being duplicated rather than shared with uninstall.sh.
# Deliberately simpler than lt_run_with_timeout() though: no stdout/stderr
# tempfile capture, since every caller here already discards
# clone_pinned()'s output wholesale (`>/dev/null 2>&1` in the retry loop
# below) rather than needing it back as a string.
